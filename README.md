This is a simple experiment using Privy to log in and write with Farcaster. Once approving the profile manager you can cast, remove casts, like, and recast.

## Documentation

I integrated Farcaster login with Privy by following [this guide](https://docs.privy.io/guide/react/recipes/misc/farcaster).
and referred to the [Privy Farcaster Write documentation](https://docs.privy.io/guide/react/recipes/misc/farcaster-writes).
